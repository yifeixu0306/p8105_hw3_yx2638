# Problem 1

``` r
# load the "Instacart" data from the "p8105.datasets"
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

The dataset `instacart` contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each
row resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables
include identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which
each product was added to the cart. There are several order-level
variables, describing the day and time of the order, and number of days
since prior order. Then there are several item-specific variables,
describing the product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department
(e.g. dairy and eggs, produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits),
and whether the item has been ordered by this user in the past. In
total, there are 39123 products found in 131209 orders from 131209
distinct users.

``` r
# summarize the number of items ordered from aisle
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240

    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

In total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
# plot the number of items ordered in each aisle
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the

# Problem 2

#### Read in the data

``` r
accel = read_csv("data/accel_data.csv") 
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

#### Tidy and wrangle the data

``` r
accel_tidy = accel %>%
        janitor::clean_names() %>%
        pivot_longer(activity_1:activity_1440, names_to = "minute", values_to = "activity_counts", names_prefix =  "activity_") %>%
        mutate(day = day %>% 
                       fct_relevel("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday","Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")) %>% 
        mutate(weekday_vs_weekend = ifelse(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")) %>%
        mutate(minute = as.integer(minute)) 
```

The resulting dataset contains 50400 observations. 6 key variables
include week, day_id, day, minute, activity_counts, weekday_vs_weekend.
Each observation represent a male’s activity count per minute of each
day during five weeks.

#### Create a table to show the total activity counts

``` r
# aggregate across minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals
accel_tidy %>%
        group_by(week, day) %>%
        summarize(total_activity_counts = sum(activity_counts)) %>%
        knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| week | day       | total_activity_counts |
|-----:|:----------|----------------------:|
|    1 | Monday    |              78828.07 |

|    2 | Tuesday   |             423245.00 |
|    2 | Wednesday |             440962.00 |
|    2 | Thursday  |             474048.00 |

|    3 | Friday    |             467420.00 |
|    3 | Saturday  |             382928.00 |
|    3 | Sunday    |             467052.00 |
|    4 | Monday    |             409450.00 |
|    4 | Tuesday   |             319568.00 |
|    4 | Wednesday |             434460.00 |
|    4 | Thursday  |             340291.00 |
|    4 | Friday    |             154049.00 |
|    4 | Saturday  |               1440.00 |
|    4 | Sunday    |             260617.00 |
|    5 | Monday    |             389080.00 |
|    5 | Tuesday   |             367824.00 |
|    5 | Wednesday |             445366.00 |
|    5 | Thursday  |             549658.00 |
|    5 | Friday    |             620860.00 |
|    5 | Saturday  |               1440.00 |
|    5 | Sunday    |             138421.00 |

We cannot observe apparent trend from the table. However, it’s obvious
that the total activity accounts on Saturdays in week 4 and week 5 is
far lower than any other days.

#### Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each day

``` r
accel_tidy %>%
        group_by(day, minute) %>%
        ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = activity_counts)) +
        geom_point(aes(color = day), alpha = 0.5) +
        scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
        geom_smooth() + 
        scale_x_continuous(
                breaks = c(0, 180, 360, 540, 720, 900, 1080, 1260, 1440),
                labels = c("12am", "3am", "6am", "9am", "12pm", "3pm", "6pm", "9pm", "12am")) + 
        labs(x = "Time", 
             y = "Activity Counts", 
             title = "24-hour Activity Time Courses for Each Day")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_yx2638_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" />

Within a day, we can observe that the activity count of this male is
very low between 12am and 3am, and then begins to increase. Around 9-12w
wwwam, the activity count reaches the first peak, after then it remains
with little fluctuation. The second peak occurs around 9pm, after which
the activity account begins to decline.

Within weekday, his activity count is relatively high around 7am on some
Thursdays and around 9am on some Fridays. As for the weekend, the
activity count is high in the afternoon, especially around 4-5pm on
Saturday and around 12pm on Sunday. Between 8-10pm, the count is usually
high across many days, especially on Friday.

From this plot, we can roughly identify his daily schedule (such as the
time of wake-up and sleep).
